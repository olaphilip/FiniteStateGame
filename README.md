# FiniteStateGame

For this game, I used Twine to create a passage that demonstrates the concept of "State"
Each node in the passage gives user a choice (mostly 2)
Depending on their choice, they will have different paths

## Main story

The story of this game is about the player waking up in a location without knowing where they are at. Their mission is to escape. If they find the key in the room they wake up in, they escape quicker. If they don't, two destinies lie ahead for them. Finding another way to escape or meeting their end.
